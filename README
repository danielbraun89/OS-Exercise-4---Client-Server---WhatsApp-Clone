REMARKS:

whatsappio.cpp  has been adapted to our implementation (parse_command not expecting \n at the end of message)

ANSWERS:

1.
first we will change the parse_command to include leave_group 
Client changes:
	is that it will wait for answer from server and print the according message

Server change :
	our implementation has every group as a set, and a map that maps group names to their
	corresponding set.  
	so incase of group_leave we find the group set (report error if do not exists) 
	see if the client is there (if not send an error) 
	and then remove the client name from this particular group set. close it if it reaches 0 and remove from the map


2.
when a servers could handle a lot of clients in parrallel and also not using threads, it may be occupied when some client send a message
so it may miss some data we need to make sure the data is intact.
moreover the content is not real-time oriented as video or audio, we take the performance hit in orer to make sure the text is readable 

3.
skype for VOIP  
netflix for video streaming,
UDP is preferable because there is no meaning for data lost as it is no longer relevant to the user as he is consuming the data in real-time.

4. 
clients can save a data base of their own, and when they connect to the server for the first time they send the server (along with their name) all the saved data they posses,
the server then parse their data and build its structure according to it.
